# Weather App - Chen Shelly 

This is a simple weather application that allows users to check the current weather and 5-day forecast for different locations.
Users can add locations to their favorites and view details about them.

## Features

- View current weather and 5-day forecast for a given city.
- Add and remove cities from favorites.
- View a list of favorite cities and their weather details.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
React
JSON Server

## Project Structure

public/: Contains static assets.
src/: Contains the React application source code.
components/: Reusable React components.
pages/: Individual pages of the application.
App.js: Main entry point for the application.
data.json: JSON file storing favorite cities and their details.


## JSON Server for Data Storage
This project uses json-server to simulate a backend for storing favorite cities. The data.json file serves as a simple database. 
To start the JSON server,run the following command:
### `json-server --watch data.json --port 3000`


## Acknowledgments
Weather data provided by AccuWeather API.
pages/constants.js: contain the AccuWeather API keys.
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
